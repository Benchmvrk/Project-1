Mission: Here on Crypton (name thought of by Milon), we want to make sure that everyone has a chance to possibly strike it big and provide the tools neccessary for such. At Crypton, you're not just an ordinary person, you're super and the best kind of super is super rich.

Description: Crypton is a cryto-currency tracker that lets you view news, past values of the currency, and store specific coins that you are interested in. You are able to choose from the exchanges from the left dropdown, which will populate the Coin button. Clicking on such will bring up a modal with the various crypocurrencies in that exchange. If there is one you are interested in, you can click on it and this will populate the graph and store its data in the bottom div. Firebase is used for persistence, so refreshing the page will not make the coins disappear. Future updates will include: Firebase user integration that allows for storing of coins for specific users, a live-time chart that updates with the market, and buying/trading coins. 

Programs used:
